Hello there! 

thanks for downloading, i hope this pack will be useful for your work; let me 
know if that's the case and if you want to suggest quality of life improvements
that may be useful to make this pack better. 

Now some informations and warnings that may be useful for the use of the assets:



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Measurements for creating grid and tile palettes in pxs:
 
 - single square tile (SQ): 360 X 360 
 - single column: 18 SQ / 1080 X 2160
 - single row of baground columns with wall: 90 SQ / 4680 X 2160
 - single wall background for internal columns: 12 SQ / 1080 X 1440
                       +
             single internal column

When you insert all of the tiles for the terrain tilemap in your engine, know 
that bleeding may occur. i tried to make them as precise as i could and tried
to prevent that, but unfortunately it looks there's a limit to what i can do. 
one way to solve it is to enlarge the borders of the single tiles with this 
issue of one, two or more rows of pixel of color, so that the grid should 
always fine something to show instead of empty pixels; that said there are a lot
of variations of this problem and so are the solutions, so you'll have to find 
your for yourself. 
If you actually know something more i could've done to prevent this, please tell
me in the comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the terrain tilemap and assets:

It should be pretty complete, with a piece or a combination of them for a lot 
of situations and compositions, but there's the possibility that you're specific
need may not be covered. The best way to understand id that's the case is to try
out different combinations yourself and see what sticks. 

The terrain tiles are mainly divided in two categories for combination, those 
being half tiles, meaning that their heaight is half a SQ, and the full tiles, 
meaning that their height is a full SQ. Clearly, halfs do not connect with fulls, 
but there are a lot of connectors for different situations that lets you jump 
from one to the other; there are also some that do not, like some of the slides
just go from half to half and full to full, so look carefully what is what while
composing. 

One tile may not solve everything and you could need to combine various others 
for some particular needs. For exemple, if you want to create long stairs, using 
only the single stair tile won't probably be enough; you'll need to combine it 
with some wall tiles and floor tile for when you reach the half tile height. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the background tiles:

You're free to use them how you see fit or not use them at all. 

I made the base empty columns so that you can use a singular SQ of the pillar 
and modify the height of the columns however you want just by repeating it. 

I made them with the intent of creating a multilayered backgrounds that would
have a parallax movement, so creating a depth perception.

The darker columns, with already a a wall composed in them, were made to be a 
background to the background, but while i scaled them i couldn't keep the 
repeateability of the single columns, plus because of the different pattern in 
the wall, so i just made various ready to use combinations. 
I suggest also using them as a tilemap, just not with the grid separating the 
single columns but the single large sections and use them as pieces, as 
indicated in the measurements section. 
If you wonder why those sections are divided by a black band, it's because i 
envisioned the parallax movement, in the project i made these for, to be only 
along the x axis, so that section, considering those columns are slightly 
smaller than the other, is to fill the missing part to make them connect to the 
same grid as the columns in the foreground. That said, you're free to ditch 
this system and to cut the dark sections, or to just not use these, but only 
the normal columns. 

those extra "internal columns", as i named, were so to create an even closer 
foreground and some "rooms", so to say, if there was ever the need. the idea for
them was the make them bound to the terrain tiles, no parallax movement, and 
they connect slightly different from the normal ones, but they can still be made 
taller by repeating the SQ of the pillar, you just have to use one from the base
ones because here they are too small to have one. 
As you can see, they have a separate background, so tht you may use them freely 
with or without it, you just have to placve it ona a layer underneat, or just 
merge the images on PH and make one singular piece yourself.
The background is vertically repeatable by using the one without the arch 
shadow, so remember to use that as a measure unit per say when modifying the
height of it. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are free to rearrange all of the pieces and create your own tilemap 
organized in a way that you like, the way i put them was just a composition that
i found to be good enough to be clear, understandable and synthetic, but you 
could have a different intepretation of it.  

To ease navigation of the assets in the PSD files, i strongly recommend to turn on 
the automatic selection for the drag tool, that lets you drag whatever piece you
want just by clicking on it, without seleceting the layer first. 

To activate and deactivate the grids i made i photoshop, press Ctrl+H.

To create new ones, hold Ctrl or use the drag tool while dragging one from the 
rulers on the board of the canvas. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mushrooms were made mostly as a cheap and quick decorative lightsource, that
is way i made them glowy white, so that afterwards we could add enviromnetal 
lights on top of them through unity. 
You're free to use them as you want, or not use them at all.
